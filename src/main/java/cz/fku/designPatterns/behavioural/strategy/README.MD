#Strategy pattern
###Description
In essence, we are creating a series of algorithms, selecting one, and executing it.

The purpose of the Strategy pattern is to encapsulate these algorithms into classes 
with the same interface. By using the same interface, we make the algorithms interchangeable
with respect to the client using the algorithms and reduce the dependency on the algorithms from concrete algorithms to the interface that defines the algorithms.
